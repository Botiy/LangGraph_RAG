  "text": "Adrian is a form of the Latin given name Adrianus or Hadrianus. Its ultimate origin is most likely via the former river Adria from the Venetic and Illyrian word adur, meaning \"sea\" or \"water\".\n\nThe Adria was until the 8th century BC the main channel of the Po River into the Adriatic Sea but ceased to exist before the 1st century BC. Hecataeus of Miletus (c.550 - c.476 BC) asserted that both the Etruscan harbor city of Adria and the Adriatic Sea had been named after it. Emperor Hadrian's family was named after the city or region of Adria/Hadria, now Atri, in Picenum, which most likely started as an Etruscan or Greek colony of the older harbor city of the same name. \n\nSeveral saints and six popes have borne this name, including the only English pope, Adrian IV, and the only Dutch pope, Adrian VI. As an English name, it has been in use since the Middle Ages, although it did not become common until modern times.\n\nReligion\nPope Adrian I (c. 700–795)\nPope Adrian II (792–872)\nPope Adrian III (died 885)\nPope Adrian IV (c. 1100–1159), English pope\nPope Adrian V (c. 1205–1276)\nAdrian of Batanea (died 308), Christian martyr and saint\nAdrian of Canterbury (died 710), scholar and Abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury\nAdrian of Castello (1460–1521), Italian cardinal and writer\nAdrian of May (died 875), Scottish saint from the Isle of May, martyred by Vikings\nAdrian of Moscow (1627–1700), last pre-revolutionary Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia\nAdrian of Nicomedia (died 306), martyr and Herculian Guard of the Roman Emperor Galerius Maximian\nAdrian of Ondrusov (died 1549), Russian Orthodox saint and wonder-worker\nAdrian of Poshekhonye (died 1550), Russian Orthodox saint, hegumen of Dormition monastery in Yaroslavl region\nAdrian Fortescue (martyr) (1476–1539), English courtier at Henry VIII's court, beatified as a Roman Catholic martyr\nAdrian Gouffier de Boissy (1479–1523), French Roman Catholic bishop and cardinal\nAdrian Kivumbi Ddungu (1923–2009), Ugandan Roman Catholic bishop\nAdrian Leo Doyle (born 1936), Australian prelate of the Roman Catholic Church\n\nGovernment, politics and the military\nAdrian Amstutz (born 1953), Swiss politician\nAdrian Bailey (born 1945), British Labour Co-operative politician\nAdrian Baillie (1898–1947), British politician\nAdrian von Bubenberg (1434–1479), Bernese knight, military commander and mayor\nAdrian P.
