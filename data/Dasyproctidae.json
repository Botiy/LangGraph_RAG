  "text": "Dasyproctidae is a family of large South American rodents, comprising the agoutis and acouchis. Their fur is a reddish or dark colour above, with a paler underside. They are herbivorous, often feeding on ripe fruit that falls from trees. They live in burrows, and, like squirrels, will bury some of their food for later use.\n\nDasyproctids exist in Central and South America, which are the tropical parts of the New World. The fossil record of this family can be traced back to the Late Oligocene (Deseadan in the SALMA classification).\n\nAs with all rodents, members of this family have incisors, pre-molars, and molars, but no canines. The cheek teeth are hypsodont and flat-crowned.\n\nClassification \nFossil taxa follow McKenna and Bell, with modifications following Kramarz.\n\n Family Dasyproctidae\n Genus †Alloiomys\n Genus †Australoprocta\n Genus †Branisamys\n Genus †Incamys\n Genus †Neoreomys\n Genus †Megastus\n Genus †Palmiramys\n Genus Dasyprocta\n Azara's agouti, D. azarae\n Coiban agouti, D. coibae\n Crested agouti, D. cristata\n Black agouti, D. fuliginosa\n Orinoco agouti, D. guamara\n Kalinowski's agouti, D. kalinowskii\n Red-rumped agouti, D. leporina\n Mexican agouti, D. mexicana\n Black-rumped agouti, D. prymnolopha\n Central American agouti, D. punctata\n Ruatan Island agouti, D. ruatanica\n Genus Myoprocta\n Green acouchi, M. pratti\n Red acouchi, M. acouchy\n\nThe pacas (genus Cuniculus) are placed by some authorities in Dasyproctidae, but molecular studies have demonstrated they do not form a monophyletic group.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Central American agouti at Smithsonian\n Dasyproctidae at Animaldiversity.org\n 2014 - Figueira et al. - Carrion consumption by Dasyprocta leporina (Rodentia: Dasyproctidae) and a review of meat use by agoutis\n\n \nHystricognath rodents\nRodent families\nExtant Chattian first appearances\nMammals described in 1825"
