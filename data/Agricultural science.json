  "text": "Agricultural science (or agriscience for short) is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. Professionals of the agricultural science are called agricultural scientists or agriculturists.\n\nHistory\n\nIn the 18th century, Johann Friedrich Mayer conducted experiments on the use of gypsum (hydrated calcium sulphate) as a fertilizer.\n\nIn 1843, John Lawes and Joseph Henry Gilbert began a set of long-term field experiments at Rothamsted Research Station in England, some of which are still running as of 2018.\n\nIn the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the Hatch Act of 1887, which used the term \"agricultural science\". The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. The Smith-Hughes Act of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built. After 1906, public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years.\n\nProminent agricultural scientists\n\n Robert Bakewell\n Norman Borlaug\n Luther Burbank\n George Washington Carver\n Carl Henry Clerk\n George C.

However, they cover different concepts:\nAgriculture is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.\nAgronomy is research and development related to studying and improving plant-based crops.\n\nSoil forming factors and soil degradation\nAgricultural sciences include research and development on:\n Improving agricultural productivity in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of drought-resistant crops and animals, development of new pesticides, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro cell culture techniques)\n Minimizing the effects of pests (weeds, insects, pathogens, mollusks, nematodes) on crop or animal production systems.\n Transformation of primary products into end-consumer products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of dairy products)\n Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., soil degradation, waste management, bioremediation)\n Theoretical production ecology, relating to crop production modeling\n Traditional agricultural systems, sometimes termed subsistence agriculture, which feed most of the poorest people in the world.  These systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological systems greater than that of industrial agriculture, which may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems.\n Food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers, such as China, India, Brazil, the US and the EU.\n Various sciences relating to agricultural resources and the environment (e.g. soil science, agroclimatology); biology of agricultural crops and animals (e.g. crop science, animal science and their included sciences, e.g. ruminant nutrition, farm animal welfare); such fields as agricultural economics and rural sociology; various disciplines encompassed in agricultural engineering.\n\nSee also\n Agricultural Research Council\n Agricultural sciences basic topics\n Agriculture ministry\n Agroecology\n American Society of Agronomy\n Genomics of domestication\n History of agricultural science\n Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences\n International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development\n International Food Policy Research Institute, IFPRI\n List of agriculture topics\n National FFA Organization\n Research Institute of Crop Production (RICP) (in the Czech Republic)\n University of Agricultural Sciences\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nAgricultural Research, Livelihoods, and Poverty: Studies of Economic and Social Impacts in Six Countries Edited by Michelle Adato and Ruth Meinzen-Dick (2007), Johns Hopkins University Press Food Policy Report\nClaude Bourguignon, Regenerating the Soil: From Agronomy to Agrology, Other India Press, 2005\nPimentel David, Pimentel Marcia, Computer les kilocalories, Cérès, n. 59, sept-oct. 1977\nRussell E.
