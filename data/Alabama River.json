  "text": "The Alabama River, in the U.S. state of Alabama, is formed by the Tallapoosa and Coosa rivers, which unite about  north of Montgomery, near the town of Wetumpka.\n\nThe river flows west to Selma, then southwest until, about  from Mobile, it unites with the Tombigbee, forming the Mobile and Tensaw rivers, which discharge into Mobile Bay.\n\nDescription\nThe run of the Alabama is highly meandering. Its width varies from , and its depth from . Its length as measured by the United States Geological Survey is , and by steamboat measurement, .\n\nThe river crosses the richest agricultural and timber districts of the state.  Railways connect it with the mineral regions of north-central Alabama.\n\nAfter the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers, the principal tributary of the Alabama is the Cahaba River, which is about  long and joins the Alabama River about  below Selma. The Alabama River's main tributary, the Coosa River, crosses the mineral region of Alabama and is navigable for light-draft boats from Rome, Georgia, to about  above Wetumpka (about  below Rome and  below Greensport), and from Wetumpka to its junction with the Tallapoosa. The channel of the river has been considerably improved by the federal government.\n\nThe navigation of the Tallapoosa River – which has its source in Paulding County, Georgia, and is about  long – is prevented by shoals and a  fall at Tallassee, a few miles north of its junction with the Coosa. The Alabama is navigable throughout the year.\n\nThe river played an important role in the growth of the economy in the region during the 19th century as a source of transportation of goods, which included slaves. The river is still used for transportation of farming produce; however, it is not as important as it once was due to the construction of roads and railways.\n\nDocumented by Europeans first in 1701, the Alabama, Coosa, and Tallapoosa rivers were central to the homeland of the Creek Indians before their removal by United States forces to the Indian Territory in the 1830s.\n\nEdmund Pettus Bridge\nThe Edmund Pettus Bridge crosses the Alabama River near Selma. The bridge was the site of the famous marches for voting rights in 1965; the first became known as \"Bloody Sunday\" because the state and county police beat protesters after they crossed out of the city.\n\nLock and dams\nThe Alabama River has three lock and dams between Montgomery and the Mobile River.  The Robert F. Henry Lock & Dam is located at river mile 236.2, the Millers Ferry Lock & Dam is located at river mile 133.0, and the Claiborne Lock & Dam is located at river mile 72.5.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\nList of Alabama rivers\nTallapoosa River\nCoosa River\nMobile River\n South Atlantic-Gulf Water Resource Region\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nAllrefer.com\n\n \nRivers of Autauga County, Alabama\nRivers of Monroe County, Alabama\nRivers of Montgomery County, Alabama\nRivers of Wilcox County, Alabama\nRivers of Dallas County, Alabama\nRivers of Mobile County, Alabama\nRivers of Elmore County, Alabama\nRivers of Alabama"
