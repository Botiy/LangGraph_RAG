  "text": "Acoustic theory is a scientific field that relates to the description of sound waves. It derives from fluid dynamics. See acoustics for the engineering approach.\n\nFor sound waves of any magnitude of a disturbance in velocity, pressure, and density we have\n \n\nIn the case that the fluctuations in velocity, density, and pressure are small, we can approximate these as\n \n\nWhere  is the perturbed velocity of the fluid,  is the pressure of the fluid at rest,  is the perturbed pressure of the system as a function of space and time,  is the density of the fluid at rest, and  is the variance in the density of the fluid over space and time.\n\nIn the case that the velocity is irrotational (), we then have the acoustic wave equation that describes the system:\n\nWhere we have\n\nDerivation for a medium at rest\nStarting with the Continuity Equation and the Euler Equation:\n \n\nIf we  take small perturbations of a constant pressure and density:\n \n\nThen the equations of the system are\n \n\nNoting that the equilibrium pressures and densities are constant, this simplifies to\n\nA Moving Medium\nStarting with\n \n\nWe can have these equations work for a moving medium by setting , where  is the constant velocity that the whole fluid is moving at before being disturbed (equivalent to a moving observer) and  is the fluid velocity.\n\nIn this case the equations look very similar:\n \n\nNote that setting  returns the equations at rest.\n\nLinearized Waves\nStarting with the above given equations of motion for a medium at rest:\n \n\nLet us now take  to all be small quantities.\n\nIn the case that we keep terms to first order, for the continuity equation, we have the  term going to 0. This similarly applies for the density perturbation times the time derivative of the velocity. Moreover, the spatial components of the material derivative go to 0. We thus have, upon rearranging the equilibrium density:\n \n\nNext, given that our sound wave occurs in an ideal fluid, the motion is adiabatic, and then we can relate the small change in the pressure to the small change in the density by\n \n\nUnder this condition, we see that we now have\n \n\nDefining the speed of sound of the system:\n \n\nEverything becomes\n\nFor Irrotational Fluids\nIn the case that the fluid is irrotational, that is , we can then write  and thus write our equations of motion as\n \n\nThe second equation tells us that\n \n\nAnd the use of this equation in the continuity equation tells us that\n \n\nThis simplifies to\n \n\nThus the velocity potential  obeys the wave equation in the limit of small disturbances. The boundary conditions required to solve for the potential come from the fact that the velocity of the fluid must be 0 normal to the fixed surfaces of the system.\n\nTaking the time derivative of this wave equation and multiplying all sides by the unperturbed density, and then using the fact that  tells us that\n \n\nSimilarly, we saw that . Thus we can multiply the above equation appropriately and see that\n \n\nThus, the velocity potential, pressure, and density all obey the wave equation. Moreover, we only need to solve one such equation to determine all other three. In particular, we have\n\nFor a moving medium\nAgain, we can derive the small-disturbance limit for sound waves in a moving medium. Again, starting with\n \n\nWe can linearize these into\n\nFor Irrotational Fluids in a Moving Medium\nGiven that we saw that\n \n\nIf we make the previous assumptions of the fluid being ideal and the velocity being irrotational, then we have\n \n\nUnder these assumptions, our linearized sound equations become\n \n\nImportantly, since  is a constant, we have , and then the second equation tells us that\n \n\nOr just that\n \n\nNow, when we use this relation with the fact that , alongside cancelling and rearranging terms, we arrive at\n \n\nWe can write this in a familiar form as\n\nThis differential equation must be solved with the appropriate boundary conditions. Note that setting  returns us the wave equation. Regardless, upon solving this equation for a moving medium, we then have\n\nSee also\n Acoustic attenuation\n Sound\n Fourier analysis\n\nReferences\n \n \n\nFluid dynamics\nAcoustics\nSound"
