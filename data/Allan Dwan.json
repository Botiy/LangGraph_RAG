  "text": "Allan Dwan (born Joseph Aloysius Dwan; April 3, 1885 – December 28, 1981) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director, producer, and screenwriter.\n\nEarly life\nBorn Joseph Aloysius Dwan in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Dwan, was the younger son of commercial traveler of woolen clothing Joseph Michael Dwan (1857–1917) and his wife Mary Jane Dwan, née Hunt. The family moved to the United States when he was seven years old on December 4, 1892 by ferry from Windsor to Detroit, according to his naturalization petition of August 1939. His elder brother, Leo Garnet Dwan (1883–1964), became a physician.\n\nAllan Dwan studied engineering at the University of Notre Dame and then worked for a lighting company in Chicago. He had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry, and when Essanay Studios offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. At that time, some of the East Coast movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round, and in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association.\n\nCareer\nDwan operated Flying A Studios in La Mesa, California from August 1911 to July 1912. Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history. On August 12, 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue and La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the Flying A Studios origins in La Mesa, California.\n\nAfter making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American Mary Pickford in several very successful movies as well as her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, notably in the acclaimed 1922 Robin Hood. Dwan directed Gloria Swanson in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process Phonofilm. This short, also featuring Thomas Meighan and Henri de la Falaise, was produced as a joke, for the April 26, 1925 \"Lambs' Gambol\" for The Lambs, with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the talkies, Dwan directed child-star Shirley Temple in Heidi (1937) and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938).\n\nDwan helped launch the career of two other successful Hollywood directors, Victor Fleming, who went on to direct The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind, and Marshall Neilan, who became an actor, director, writer and producer. Over a long career spanning almost 50 years, Dwan directed 125 motion pictures, some of which were highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office hit, Sands of Iwo Jima. He directed his last movie in 1961.\n\nHe died in Los Angeles at the age of 96, and is interred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery, Mission Hills, California.\n\nDwan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nDaniel Eagan of Film Journal International described Dwan as one of the early pioneers of cinema, stating that his style \"is so basic as to seem invisible, but he treats his characters with uncommon sympathy and compassion.\"\n\nPartial filmography as director\n\nThe Gold Lust (1911)\nThe Picket Guard (1913)\nThe Restless Spirit (1913)\nBack to Life (1913)\nBloodhounds of the North (1913)\nThe Lie (1914)\nThe Honor of the Mounted (1914)\n The Unwelcome Mrs. Hatch (1914)\nRemember Mary Magdalen (1914)\nDiscord and Harmony (1914)\nThe Embezzler (1914)\nThe Lamb, the Woman, the Wolf (1914)\nThe End of the Feud (1914)\nThe Test (1914) (*writer)\nThe Tragedy of Whispering Creek (1914)\nThe Unlawful Trade (1914)\nThe Forbidden Room (1914)\nThe Hopes of Blind Alley (1914)\nRichelieu (1914)\n Wildflower (1914)\nA Small Town Girl (1915)\nDavid Harum (1915)\nA Girl of Yesterday (1915)\nThe Pretty Sister of Jose (1915)\n Jordan Is a Hard Road (1915)\nBetty of Graystone (1916)\nThe Habit of Happiness (1916)\nThe Good Bad Man (1916)\nAn Innocent Magdalene (1916)\nThe Half-Breed (1916)\nManhattan Madness (1916)\nAccusing Evidence (1916)\nPanthea (1917)\nA Modern Musketeer (1917)\nBound in Morocco (1918)\nHeadin' South (1918)\nMr. Fix-It (1918)\nHe Comes Up Smiling (1918)\nCheating Cheaters (1919)\nThe Dark Star (1919)\nGetting Mary Married (1919)\nSoldiers of Fortune (1919)\nIn The Heart of a Fool (1920) also producer\nThe Forbidden Thing (1920) also producer\nA Splendid Hazard (1920)\nA Perfect Crime (1921)\n The Sin of Martha Queed (1921)\n A Broken Doll (1921)\nRobin Hood (1922)\nZaza (1923)\nBig Brother (1923)\nManhandled (1924)\nArgentine Love (1924)\nThe Coast of Folly (1925)\nNight Life of New York (1925)\nStage Struck (1925)\nGloria Swanson Dialogue (1925) short film made in Phonofilm for The Lambs annual \"Gambol\" held at Metropolitan Opera House\nPadlocked (1926)\nSea Horses (1926)\nSummer Bachelors (1926)\nTin Gods (1926)\nFrench Dressing (1927)\nThe Joy Girl (1927)\nEast Side, West Side (1927)\nThe Big Noise (1928)\nFrozen Justice (1929)\nThe Iron Mask (1929)\nTide of Empire (1929)\nThe Far Call (1929)\nWhat a Widow!
