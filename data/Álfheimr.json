  "text": "In Norse cosmology, Álfheimr (Old Norse: , \"Land of the Elves\" or \"Elfland\"; anglicized as Alfheim), also called \"Ljósálfheimr\" ( , \"home of the Light Elves\"), is home of the Light Elves.\n\nIn Old Norse texts\n\nÁlfheim as an abode of the Elves is mentioned only twice in Old Norse texts.\n\nThe eddic poem Grímnismál describes twelve divine dwellings beginning in stanza 5 with:\nÝdalir call they     the place where Ull\nA hall for himself hath set;\nAnd Álfheim the gods     to Frey once gave\nAs a tooth-gift in ancient times.\n\nA tooth-gift was a gift given to an infant on the cutting of the first tooth.\n\nIn the 12th century eddic prose Gylfaginning, Snorri Sturluson relates it as the first of a series of abodes in heaven:\nThat which is called Álfheim is one, where dwell the peoples called ljósálfar [Light Elves]; but the dökkálfar [Dark Elves] dwell down in the earth, and they are unlike in appearance, but by far more unlike in nature. The Light-elves are fairer to look upon than the sun, but the Dark-elves are blacker than pitch.\nThe account later, in speaking of a hall in the Highest Heaven called Gimlé that shall survive when heaven and earth have died, explains:\nIt is said that another heaven is to the southward and upward of this one, and it is called Andlang [Andlangr 'Endlong'] but the third heaven is yet above that, and it is called Vídbláin [Vídbláinn 'Wide-blue'] and in that heaven we think this abode is. But we believe that none but Light-Elves inhabit these mansions now.\nIt is not indicated whether these heavens are identical to Álfheim or distinct. Some texts read Vindbláin (Vindbláinn 'Wind-blue') instead of Vídbláin.\n\nModern commentators speculate (or sometimes state as fact) that Álfheim was one of the nine worlds (heima) mentioned in stanza 2 of the eddic poem Völuspá.\n\nSee also\n Fairyland\n  Svartálfar (black elves)\n Alfheimbjerg\n\nSources\n\nLocations in Norse mythology\nSaga locations\nElves\nFreyr"
