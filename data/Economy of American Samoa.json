  "text": "The economy of American Samoa is a traditional Polynesian economy in which more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity is strongly linked to the United States, with which American Samoa conducts the great bulk of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and processing plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna being the primary export. Transfers from the U.S. federal government add substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes.\n\nStatistics\n\nGDP: purchasing power parity – $537 million (2007 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world: 210\n\nGDP (official exchange rate): $462.2 million (2005)\n\nGDP – real growth rate: 3% (2003)\ncountry comparison to the world: 139\n\nGDP – per capita: purchasing power parity – $7,874 (2008)\ncountry comparison to the world: 120\n\nGDP – composition by sector:\nagriculture:\nNA%\nindustry:\nNA%\nservices:\nNA% (2002)\n\nLabor Force: 17,630 (2005)\ncountry comparison to the world: 203\n\nLabor force – by occupation: government 33%, tuna canneries 34%, other 33% (1990)\n\nUnemployment rate: 23.8% (2010)\ncountry comparison to the world: 175\n\nPopulation below poverty line:\nNA% (2002 est.)\n\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\nlowest 10%:\nNA%\nhighest 10%:\nNA%\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\nNA% (2003 est.)\n\nBudget:\nrevenues: $155.4 million (37% in local revenue and 63% in US grants)\nexpenditures: $183.6 million (FY07)\n\nAgriculture – products: bananas, coconuts, vegetables, taro, breadfruit, yams, copra, pineapples, papayas; dairy products, livestock\n\nIndustries: tuna canneries (largely dependent on foreign fishing vessels), handicrafts\n\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\n\nElectricity – production: 180 GWh (2006)\ncountry comparison to the world: 179\n\nElectricity – production by source:\nfossil fuel:\n100%\nhydro:\n0%\nnuclear:\n0%\nother:\n0% (2001)\n\nElectricity – consumption: 167.4 GWh (2006)\ncountry comparison to the world: 179\n\nElectricity – exports: 0 kWh (2007)\n\nElectricity – imports: 0 kWh (2007)\n\nOil – production:  (2007 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world: 209\n\nOil – consumption:  (604 m³/d), 2006\ncountry comparison to the world: 170\n\nOil – exports:  (2005)\ncountry comparison to the world: 142\n\nOil – imports:  (2005)\ncountry comparison to the world: 166\n\nNatural gas – production: 0 cu m (2007)\ncountry comparison to the world: 208\n\nNatural gas – consumption: 0 cu m (2007)\ncountry comparison to the world: 207\n\nNatural gas – exports: 0 cu m (2007)\ncountry comparison to the world: 202\n\nNatural gas – imports: 0 cu m (2007)\ncountry comparison to the world: 201\n\nNatural gas – proved reserves: 0 cu m (2006)\ncountry comparison to the world: 205\n\nExports: $445.6 million (2004)\ncountry comparison to the world: 167\n\nExports – commodities:\ncanned tuna 93% (2004)\n\nExports – partners:\nIndonesia 70%, Australia 6.7%, Japan 6.7%, Samoa 6.7% (2002)\n\nImports: $308.8 million (2004)\ncountry comparison to the world: 195\n\nImports – commodities:\nmaterials for canneries 56%, food 8%, petroleum products 7%, machinery and parts 6% (2004)\n\nImports – partners:\nAustralia 36.6%, New Zealand 20.3%, South Korea 16.3%, Mauritius 4.9% (2002)\n\nDebt – external:\n$NA (2002 est.)\n\nEconomic aid – recipient:\n$NA; note – important financial support from the US, more than $40 million in 1994\n\nCurrency:\nUS dollar (USD)\n\nCurrency code:\nUSD\n\nExchange rates:\nUS dollar is used\n\nFiscal year:\n1 October – 30 September\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n http://www.classbrain.com/art_cr/publish/american_samoa_economy.shtml"
